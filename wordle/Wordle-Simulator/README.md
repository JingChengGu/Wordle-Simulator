## Wordle Simulator

### Program Description
-  Since Wordle became incredibly popular in 2022, I created my own interpretation of the game. The program was created in C language and ran through Ubuntu.

### How to Use/Logistics
- The program would first ask the user to input a 5 letter word.

- Then it would output either three letters (g, y, x) in a 5 letter sequence. (g: green, the letter is in the right position. y: yellow, the letter is in the word but not in the right position. x: grey, the letter is not in the word).

- When all letters are in the correct position, the prgram would congratulate the user for winning and informs the user how many trails it took for them to find the desired word.
